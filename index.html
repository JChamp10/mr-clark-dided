        <h1>The Case of Mr. Clark</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the investigation of Mr. Clark. Please listen to the details below.Our “true crime” podcast relates to the literary genres crime and science fiction, as well as our analysis genre purpose because a true crime podcast covers the crime of a person, and science fiction the steps towards finding him and bringing him to justice. True crime podcasts use purpose to find the perpetrator’s motives. In this story, the crime was the murder of Mr. Clark, or was it? The interviews show that there were two sides to Mr Clark, and the real crimes may have been by him, adding a layer of intricacy to the story.. Science fiction is involved as well. In the tale, there were CIA rabbits, which is quite far-fetched, incorporating a level of fiction to the story. We see purpose when we listen to how Mr. Clark treated the students, and why he may have been murdered in cold blood, but there is still a level of mystery showing that that may not have been the only motive. All in all, this podcast ties up crime, science fiction, and purpose into a chilling story of the death of the man known as Clark. Innocent or not? Time will tell. In the John Truby anatomy of genres texts, it says that Crime follows science fiction because science fiction is about building society and crime is about upholding the rules and values of society to keep it functioning. We can see that in the podcast and story in the structure of it. Mr. Clark(a fictional character), can be assumed from the story to be doing unregulated, inappropriate and unlawful activities. In the end, he gets his just demise. The podcast can be interpreted as a metaphor, though completely exaggerated, on how criminals get their just end, no matter how long it takes.
